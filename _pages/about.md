+ I'm an intern at [VERSE lab](https://verse-lab.github.io/), under a supervision of [Ilya Sergey](https://ilyasergey.net/).
+ I am broadly interested in formal verification, bioinformatics, and algorithms.
+ I have contributed to several research projects, with results presented at conferences and published in abstracts. I enjoy tackling complex
problems through computational approaches and collaborating with experts in interdisciplinary fields. 
+ My goal is to further develop my expertise and contribute to innovative research in Computer Science.
